# User Stories - EquiTix

## Customer User Stories
- **Transparency:** As a fan, I want to see a chart of how the price will drop over time so I can decide whether to buy now or risk waiting.
- **Impact:** As a socially conscious buyer, I want to know exactly which cause my high-priced "early access" donation is supporting.
- **Convenience:** As a bargain hunter, I want to set a "Price Alert" so I don't miss the moment the ticket becomes affordable for me.
- **Legitimacy:** As a concert-goer, I want a tax-deductible receipt for the donation portion of my ticket to lower my taxable income.

## Artist User Stories
- **Brand Protection:** As an artist, I want to set high initial prices to prevent scalpers from flipping my tickets for profit, ensuring the premium goes to charity instead of the black market.
- **Public Image:** As an artist, I want to avoid being labeled "greedy" by showing that 90%+ of the premium price is a direct donation to causes I care about.
- **Market Pricing:** As an artist, I want the "market" to decide the true value of the tickets while I maintain a fair, accessible base price for my core fans.

## Administration User Stories
- **Verification:** As an admin, I want to verify the 501(c)(3) status of charities added by artists to ensure legal tax-deductibility compliance.
- **Monitoring:** As an admin, I want to monitor ticket velocity to adjust decay curves if a show is selling out too fast or too slow.
- **Financial Audit:** As an admin, I want to track the flow of funds to ensure donations are correctly routed to the intended charities.
